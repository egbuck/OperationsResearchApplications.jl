# OperationsResearchApplications

Several models/applications of Operations Research.  Some are implemented problems from textbooks.

These models are meant to be generic enough to be easily used on different data sets for a similar type of problem.

Each folder contains a problem type.  Inside each folder lies
1. .jl file(s) to run the model/application,
2. example_data/ directory to hold example data for the problem, and
3. .md file that describes an example of the problem and its formulation.
